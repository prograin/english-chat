Choreography (event-driven) ✅

Services react to events instead of a central orchestrator.

Example:
users service creates user → emits UserCreated event.
profile service listens → creates profile → emits ProfileCreated.
notifications service listens → sets up notifications.
If profile service fails → emits ProfileCreationFailed → users service deletes user (compensation).
Fully event-driven, loosely coupled.

Orchestration (central saga orchestrator)
Central orchestrator tells each service what to do.
If any step fails, orchestrator tells services to run compensating transactions.
Easier to track complex flows but adds a central dependency.
